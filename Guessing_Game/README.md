Hello professor! To run this program, please enter these commands:

$ kotlinc Guessing_Game.kt -include-runtime -d gg.jar
$ java -jar gg.jar

This is how I ran it on Linux, though it should also
work in the IDE specifically made to run Kotlin. I
just used VS Code. There is a backup.txt file for you to 
use should something go wrong with the .kt file.
